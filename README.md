future employers.

## Features
1. Contact Form 
- Because GitHub Pages is a static hosting service, it does not support server-side processing.
  So I use a third-party service, Formspree, that can handle form submissions from static sites.
  Formspree acts as a backend for my contact form, allowing me to collect form data and receive emails without 
  setting up my own server.

What are the key features of this website? (e.g., responsive layout, project filtering, smooth scrolling).

 - Front-end: 
    - HTML/CSS: For structure and styling.
